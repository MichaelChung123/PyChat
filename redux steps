Redux steps:
- Create Store in store.js
- import Provider into App.js
- import store from store.js into App.js
- Wrap App.js content with Provider, and pass in store as a prop
- make reducer folder with index.js (root reducer file).
- make reducer for what ever you want to do. reducers evaluate an action and sends state depending on what the action does
- make actions folder and make type.js that defines ALL of your actions
- make the action file and define the method to perform the functionality
- in the component file, import connect and create a mapStateToProps function that allows you to access store through props
- import the method and put it into your connect call at the end as an obj
- you can access the action method through props now
